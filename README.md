Fetal biometry for head , abdomen and femur plays great role in monitoring growth of fetus and estimating gestational age.  Here , we present a deep learning model that segment and measure succh biometires
The code is mostly adopted from Chen and here I added post-processing which includes ellipse fitting to the head regions and getting the related ellipse parameters predicted parts
